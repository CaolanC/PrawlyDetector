# PrawlyDetector
A DLL injection detector for bo3. Just testing atm, but can currently detect injected DLL's (which is how the GSC is injected). The testing required from here is whether the DLL can be hidden while still injecting GSC.

# How it works

Run the main.exe file. This will show a list of DLL's attached to the black ops 3 process. Running the test post-injection shows the t7internal.dll
